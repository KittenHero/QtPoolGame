# Qt PoolTable

![class diagram](class.png)

## Todo:

+ Add pockets
+ Mouse control
+ Default values
+ Doxygen

## Base Notes

- setters have set but getters don't have get
- abstract factory is not informative name
- Initializer has no state and one method
- Wildly inconsistent spacing around operators and variables
- So many memory leaks

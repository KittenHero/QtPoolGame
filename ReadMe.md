# Qt PoolTable

## Base Code

- How well designed was the code for extensions

The base code was well designed with abstract classes appropriately placed where extension was most likely to happen (on the ball, table and factory classes)

- what particular elements aided or hindered extensibility
- How well documented was the code with respect
- Was the coding well done
- What would I have done differently
- What was good/bad about implementation
- Code style / layout / cliche

## Extended Code

- Explain application of design pattern
- Explain advantage of patterns
- Explain disadvantage of patterns

## Base Notes

- setters have set but getters don't have get
- abstract factory is not informative name
- Initializer has no state and one method
- Wildly inconsistent spacing around operators and variables
- memory leaks
